        <dt>When do Senior Sittings generally happen?</dt>
        <dd>We schedule sittings in the spring semester for rising seniors and in the fall semester for current seniors. Please check the portrait studio’s website for available appointment dates and times.</dd>
        <dt>What should I wear?</dt>
        <dd>The portrait shows what you’re wearing down to the bottom of your ribcage. We request that you dress as if you were going to a job interview or a nice restaurant.  To make sure you are looking just perfect, we provide a full length mirror in our office and there are restrooms nearby.  If you'd like feel free to bring an interesting prop.</dd>
        <dt>Can I buy prints?</dt>
        <dd>Yes - just not from us.  We contact with <a href="//www.laurenstudios.com/">Lauren Studios</a> to handle the portraits, so please examine the proofs package you or your parents should have received to find ordering information.</dd>
