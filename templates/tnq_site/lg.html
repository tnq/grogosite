        Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>When do Living Group portraits generally happen?</dt>
        <dd>We schedule Living Group portraits throughout the Fall Semester, usually during October and November.  We take the most portraits on the weekend but can work with you to determine a time during the week if need be.</dd>
        <dt>What should we wear?</dt>
        <dd>This entirely depends on the culture of your group.  Most fraternities and sororities wear formal attire, while dorms and ILGs run the gamut from formal to zany.  We recommend deciding upon the dress code in advance within your living group.</dd>
        <dt>Where are the photos taken?</dt>
        <dd>Wherever you want!  We just ask that, if you choose an unconventional location, you don't get our photographer injured or arrested.</dd>
