<h1>Thanks!</h1>
<p>Thank you for submitting the living group scheduling form. You should be receiving a confirmation email soon, and we will contact you within the next few days to schedule the portrait.</p>
</hgroup>
<section>
<p>While getting the portrait in the yearbook is free, consider these optional packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A full page dedicated to your group with a diagram labeling every member for ${{ lg_ghostie_cost }}: </strong> The ultimate representation for every member of your living group! We'll draw the 'ghostie'-diagram by around the beginning of IAP and ask you to identify everyone in the picture. <a id="lg_photo" class="sample" href="{% get_static_prefix %}images/lg_full.png">Click here for a sample.</a></li>
<li><strong>Your group's logo or crest next to your photo for ${{ lg_crest_cost }}: </strong> Send the image as an attachment to <em>tnq-LG at mit dot edu</em>. To ensure the highest print quality, we prefer vector files (.EPS, .SVG, .AI, etc) or a high-resolution raster image (.JPG, .TIF, etc) with at least 500 pixels on its longer dimension.</li>
<li><strong>A digital copy of your photo for ${{ lg_file_cost }}: </strong> We'll send you a full resolution digital copy of your photo. These are perfect for posting on your webpage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment can be made by SAO account transfer, cash, or check made out to "MIT Technique" and can be given to the photographer on the day of your portrait. Please email us at <em>tnq-LG at mit dot edu</em> if you have any questions.</p>
