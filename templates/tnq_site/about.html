        <h1>About Technique</h1>
        <h2>Since 1885, our staph have crafted a beautiful annual of photographs and prose commemorating each year at MIT.</h2>

        <h2>Yearly</h2>
        <p>Our staph send off our 400 page annual to the publisher in February and release the book in May every year. As students and alumni of MIT, we take great care to showcase MIT in its truest form, candidly, at its best and at its worst. We know how tough the Institute can be, and we know how rewarding it is to get to the other side.</p>
        <p>Technique's staph are also responsible for running the yearly 24-hour event A Day in the Life of MIT, where anyone on MITâ€™s campus can submit a photographic journal of their day to a common website. <a href="http://aditl.mit.edu/2011/front">The last ADITL happened on September 22, 2011</a>.</p>

        <h2>Weekly</h2>
        <p>We hold regular meetings at 1pm on Saturday in W20-451. Anyone is welcome to attend. We have photographic equipment for borrowing and often teach various photography and design related seminars at this time.</p>
        <p>During book season, fall term through IAP, we hold regular meetings during the week where the various editors of each <em>Technique</em> section come in and do work. This is the best time to get involved with the process of crafting a yearbook.</p>

        <h2>Staph</h2>
        <p>Many of our staph are part time (or full time) photographers and/or designers, as well as MIT students and alumni. Most of our staph are free of infection.</p>
        <p>It takes no experience to <a href="{% url "tnq_join" %}">join Technique</a>. Our dedicated staph are committed to helping everyone who's willing to learn, especially when it's about photography or design.</p>

        <h2>H.R.H. Grogo</h2>
        <p>If you hang around Technique often, you will see this name plastered everywhere. You will also see many gorillas. This is because our mascot is a gorilla and his name is H.R.H. Grogo.</p>
        <p>"But why?" you ask. We don't know either, but H.R.H. Grogo has been there since the beginning, inscribed in the back of the very first <em>Technique</em>, and has been there ever since. We're not quite sure how or when he became a gorilla.</p>
